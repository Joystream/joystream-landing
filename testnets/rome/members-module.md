## Design

### Motivation

The membership module is supposed to represent the current set of members on the platform, and manage corresponding rich profiles, as well as the entry of new members.

### Membership

Each membership corresponds to an account, but not all accounts will have a membership. An account may only be associated with a single membership. A membership has a corresponding rich profile, including practical user facing information, such as a unique immutable handle, an avatar URI and a short descriptive text.

A membership can also be active or inactive.

### Terms

A membership is established in the context of membership terms, which describe the price of admission and human readable conditions being agreed to. At any given time there may be a range of different terms available, and the set may change over time.

### Adding members

A member can be introduced in two ways. Either way depends on the module either being open or closed for accepting new members.

The first way is for a member to simply pay for getting entry, with a reference to a given set of terms. In this case, the membership will have a reference to the terms under which it was established.

The second is for a screening authority, which is a designated account, to simply add the new member. In this case, the membership will have a reference to the screening authority.

## Name

`Membership`

## Dependencies

- `Currency`: An external currency module which supports altering balances and total issuance.

## Concepts

- `Profile`: Describes core properties and status of a membership, like a unique handle and avatar URI. Is identified with unique integer identifier, called _member id_.

- `PaidMembershipTerms`: Terms for becoming a member, like price and terms. Is identified with a unique integer identifier called a _paid terms id_.

- `UserInfo`: Information required to establish a new profile.

## State

- `NextMemberId`: Unique identifier for next member, should equal total number of members ever created.

- `AccountIdByMemberId`: Maps member id to an account id.

- `MemberIdByAccountId`: Maps account id to optional member id.

- `MemberProfile`: Maps member id to `Profile` of member.

- `Handles`: Maps handle to corresponding memberid.

- `NextPaidMembershipTermsId`: Next paid membership terms id.

- `PaidMembershipTermsById`: Maps paid terms id to actual terms.

- `ActivePaidMembershipTerms`: Set of active paid term ids.

- `NewMembershipsAllowed`: Whether new memberships can currently be established.

- `ScreeningAuthority`: Optional account of screener.

- `MinHandleLength`, `MaxHandleLength`, `MaxAvatarUriLength`, `MaxAboutTextLength`: Mutable constraint variables

## Events

- `MemberRegistered`: A member was registered with a given id and account.
- `MemberUpdatedAboutText`: A member, with given id, had text updated.
- `MemberUpdatedAvatar`: A member, with given id, had avatar URI updated.
- `MemberUpdatedHandle`: A member, with given id, had handle updated.
