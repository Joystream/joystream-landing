# GitHub Projects

The current set of relevant GitHub projects are

- [Athens Release](https://github.com/orgs/Joystream/projects/5)

# OKR results

NA.

# Release Plan

**This plan was made once, but is not kept in synch with ongoing efforts and adjustments.**

## Manager

`Martin`

## Release Date

4 April 2019, 12:00 (GMT+1)

## OKRs

### Objective: `Launch Athens network`
- **KR Measurement Deadline**: 1 week after Athens launch
- **Key Results**:
#### 1. `Get 10 claims per $ for tokens on our faucet`
#### 2. `Have all episodes of the Staked (4) and Make_World (n) podcast in the content directory`
#### 3. `Have second council upgrade consensus after reaching quorum`
#### 4. `20 Uploads (100min) and 100 Downloads not including Jsgenesis`
#### 5. `75 Memberships created (not including Jsgenesis) at a min 1/2 membership/unique view ratio`

## Constraints

- We will delay doing any serious investment in documentation, audits or specifications in this release, in order to prioritize learning how to do timely and well planned releases, before investing in these longer term assets.

- We will continue to not do any serious work in the UX, in particular in the Pioneer application, in order to move faster using the Polkadot UI framework. We can afford small tweaks here and there based on user input, but a fundamental reworking is delayed until at least after Athens.

## Risks

- **Jens** may not be able to reliably participate, and its not clear when new TT dev will be found and onboarded.

- **Bedeho** will try to contribute on Runtime work, but he also has to get familiar with Rust & Substrate, as well as other unreliable priorities.

## Specification Plans

No.

## Deployment

On-chain upgrade of runtime, no migration.

The following public products will be part of this release.
