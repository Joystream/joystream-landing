#### Item 1
1. Went through the draft Release plan point by point
2. Points that were unclear, inaccurate, missing or wrong, was corrected or marked for change.

#### Item 2
1. Martin presented a draft OKR, with an emphasis on a proposed new way of making, tracking and grading the KRs using github issues, as discussed in the [Acropolis Lessons Learned Meeting](../acropolis#lessons-learned).
    - In practice, it meant breaking down each KR into tasks
    - The tasks would be sorted by the affected parties/repos, and a checkbox would accompany each task.
    - Each task could (optionally) be assigned a weighting, to get an objective tracking of the progress.
        - Each KR issue would also include an objective and pre-defined formulae for finally grading the KR. This would not necessarily be mapped to the same tasks.
    - Each Monday, all affected parties would have a meeting, evaluating progress and checking off completed tasks.
    - A summary of that weeks meeting, alongside a tracking grade, would be added as comment by the release manager.
    - This summary would be presented on the [Weekly All Hands](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream#monday-all-hands), which would be moved to Tuesday.

2. The general sentiment was that the concept seemed like an improvement in certain areas, but the presented draft was not sufficient to convince all attendees that it sufficiently addressed the problems with the old release OKR system.

3. Attendees shall present proposals to what the KRs should cover.
